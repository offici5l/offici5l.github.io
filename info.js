    about_me: `Passionate about technology in general, I believe that true innovation lies in ideas that transcend the ordinary and create positive transformation. I began my journey in the world of programming in 2023, facing significant challenges due to limited access to a modern computerâ€”I have an old and nearly broken laptop. However, I turned this constraint into a unique opportunity, learning and developing most of my projects (about 98%) entirely using only my mobile phone. This persistence inspired me to create custom solutions for those who face similar challenges in accessing a laptop.

I adopt a flexible approach to learning, currently benefiting particularly from advancements in artificial intelligence to save time and focus on generating new ideas. I always see myself on the path of continuous learning.`
