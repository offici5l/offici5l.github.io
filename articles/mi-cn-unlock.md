# Unlock Xiaomi CN Devices

## Introduction
On October 20, 2024, Xiaomi implemented a new restriction for bootloader unlocking, affecting users with mismatched device and account regions. Users with a Chinese device linked to a global Xiaomi account, or a global device linked to a Chinese Xiaomi account, encounter the error:
Code 20045: "The place where the account is registered does not match the place where the phone is sold."
This creates a significant challenge, especially for users outside China with Chinese devices, as creating a Chinese Xiaomi account typically requires a Chinese phone number. 
Creating a Chinese Xiaomi account outside China is difficult due to the requirement of a Chinese phone number for registration on Xiaomiâ€™s official website. Even when a Chinese account is created using an email (e.g., via https://cn.account.xiaomi.com/fe/service/register/email?_uRegion=CN, tested successfully on December 4, 2024), users face another hurdle during the final bootloader unlocking step:
Code 20041: "Sorry, your Mi ID is not associated with a phone number."
This error occurs because Xiaomi mandates a phone number for account verification, and non-Chinese numbers are not accepted.
